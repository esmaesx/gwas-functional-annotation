# GWAS → Multi‑omics Prioritization — Summary

**Goal:** Show a transparent pipeline that connects GWAS signals to eQTL/pQTL evidence for interpretable target ranking.

## What’s included
- Clean scaffolding (data / notebooks / src / reports)
- Methods section in README + overview notebook
- Source links and citations
- Figure: `reports/target_ranking.png` (simulated, labeled)

## Notes
Public, reproducible methodology. Focus is on explainability rather than performance claims.

## Next steps
- Ingest a small GWAS example
- Add an eQTL/pQTL join step
- Produce a ranked list + simple figure
